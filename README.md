# Data-Analysis-Excel-Task-I

## Worksheet 1
For this task, I created an imaginary data set which was a table containing 20 rows of information with fields which included Employee ID, Employee Full Name, Department, Salary and Job type. I went ahead to clean the data and worked on the data type for each of the ranges. Then I went ahead to duplicate the dataset into 3 different sheets.

## Worksheet 2

In this worksheet, I show only employees who are freelancers and highlighted employees whose salaries are above $ 10,000. To achieve this, I used the sort and filter icon to filter out employees who are not freelancers, then I went ahead to use conditional formatting on the salary column and highlighted salaries greater than $ 10,000.

In this sheet, I had a list of employee names in one column and wanted to split these names into first names and last names. To do this, I added a new column right next to the one with employee names. Next, I selected the column containing the employee names. Then, I went to the "Data" tab in Excel. I used the "Text to Columns" feature from there. I specified that I wanted to split the text into spaces. I clicked "Finish" and agreed to let Excel replace the original data. As a result, the employee names got separated into the new columns, with first names in one and last names in the other. I didn't have any duplicate Data.

## Worksheet 3

Fot this sheet, I first selected the employee name column and used conditional formatting to highlight names that started with "E" in yellow. Then, I sorted the salary column from highest to lowest and applied a green and red color scale to highlight the salary range.

#   Excel Task 2

In this sheet, I had clean data with minimal issues. I adjusted column widths to fit content properly. I styled and centered the header row for clarity. I assigned appropriate data types like currency for money, date for dates, and text for text columns, leaving the rest as general data. This enhanced data organization and presentation.
