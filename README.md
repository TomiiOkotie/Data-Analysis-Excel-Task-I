# Data-Analysis-Excel-Task-I

For this task, I created an imaginary data set which was a table containing 20 rows of information with fields which included Employee ID, Employee Full Name, Department, Salary and Job type.

I also went ahead to clean the data and worked on the data type for each of the ranges. Then I went ahead to duplicate the dataset into 3 different sheets.

In this worksheet, I show only employees who are freelancers and highlighted employees whose salaries are above $ 10,000. To achieve this, I used the sort and filter icon to filter out employees who are not freelancers, then I went ahead to use conditional formatting on the salary column and highlighted salaries greater than $ 10,000.
